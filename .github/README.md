# Lab 3 “LOAD DATA MODULE” <Text Processing / Dicts / Lists>
    •	Read .csv file into data structure
    •	“Text Processing”? -> create a dictionary and fill it with student data
    •	Keys (not sure if we’re supposed to do one (dict) for each or just pick one):
       o	School
       o	Age
       o	Health
       o	Failures
    •	Calculate each student’s average grade
       o	Append it into the dict
   
# Lab 4 <Unit testing / sets>
    •	Unit testing:
       o	Perform a bunch of tests to ensure previously build (load data) module works “perfectly”

# Lab 5 “SORT/PLOT MODULE” <Lists/Sorting/CurveFitting/Plotting>
    •	Create a function which converts the dictionaries (created by previously written functions) into 
            LISTS of students
    •	Create functionS (multiple) *using sorting algorithms (I assume taught in lecture)* which sort
            the (above) lists according to the different data (age / grades / health etc.) AND RETURN THE 
            SORTED DATA
    •	“Do regression and/or interpolation to return the polynomial that best fits your data” – that’s 
            all it says, I don’t know which data set we’re supposed to use for that (or if it matters – 
            it shouldn’t) – also don’t know if it’s supposed to be a single function that performs 
            multiple types of regression or what…
    •	Create A function which plots histograms of the students’ data (based I guess on which sorted list
            you pass as an argument to the function?)

# Lab 6
    •	“find minimum and maximum of given data using different libraries” – whatever that means
       o	Supposed to use OPTIMIZATION AND EQUATION OF LINE OF BEST FIT --  though that might be for the 
            whole lab not just the above task
    •	Create TWO user interfaces which allow the user to “call and execute the functions created in the 
            past labs”:
       1.	Take inputs directly from the terminal to execute commands
       2.	Second will read a string of commands from a text file (“batch interface”)
    •	Create “ReadMe” file & “wrap up” whatever that means.
