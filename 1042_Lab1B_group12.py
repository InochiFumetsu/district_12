import importlib as imp               # Spencer: I am not sure of the syntax they will teach us for this in class (don't know if this is how they'll want us to do it)
imp.import_module(load_data_12.py)    #          I'm just including it to kind of show what I *THINK* they're going to have us do for the 2 "modules" we have to write.
imp.import_module(sort_plot_12.py)

#STEP 1: Gonna go ahead and edit something here in the branch to be different from the master.
